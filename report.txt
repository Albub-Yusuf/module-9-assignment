Design details how I implements the blog theme:

I try to make a simple design based on the assignment requirements.
After reading the requirements I made a rough sketch on the paper and
according to those design I made one by one page. I didn't use any css
framework for this project. Used basic html, css, font-awesome for icons
and flex layout & media queries.


Challeges & how I overcome that:

The first issue that I faced is what color scheme should I used.
I try to google about the css color combination and find various
combination. I try to pick a simple 2 tone white and green shade
color for the theme.

The second issue I faced with the responsiveness. Try to search 
how to align all the layout using flexbox. I used media queries
and tweaking each div section elements when the design broke at 
which breakpoints and fix those one by one.

This is how I made my blog project.
